**ReVytalize's Challenge Statements**
1. How can we address the escalating problem of urban blight within the city of Baton Rouge?
2. How can addressing the issue of urban blight contribute to the economy of Baton Rouge?
3. How does addressing urban blight benefit the inhabitants of Baton Rouge?


## Project Description 🪐
ReVytalize is an AI-powered platform that detects urban blight, leading to community-driven input to identify and revitalize blighted properties. The app utilizes AI via incorporating computer vision that scans street images, machine learning that analyzes readily available property and city data, and Generative AI for concise summaries from data. Providing real-time monitoring of data increases public awareness not only to detect urban blight but also to contribute to the beautification of the greater city of Baton Rouge.

## Project Value 💰
Our primary customers are city agencies, local nonprofits, and community development partners working in North Baton Rouge, who need accurate, real-time neighborhood data to inform their actions. ReVytalize provides them with a continuous stream of verified blight reports, thereby reducing the time wasted on duplicate or low-quality complaints. Tangibly, this leads to faster cleanups, more intelligent budget allocation, stronger grant applications, and measurable environmental improvement in the communities they serve.
