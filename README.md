**ReVytalize's Challenge Statements**
1. How can we address the escalating problem of urban blight within the city of Baton Rouge?
2. How can addressing the issue of urban blight contribute to the economy of Baton Rouge?
3. How does addressing urban blight benefit the inhabitants of Baton Rouge?


## Project Description 🪐
ReVytalize is an AI-powered platform that detects urban blight, leading to community-driven input to identify and revitalize blighted properties. The app utilizes AI via incorporating computer vision that scans street images, machine learning that analyzes readily available property and city data, and Generative AI for concise summaries from data. Providing real-time monitoring of data increases public awareness not only to detect urban blight but also to contribute to the beautification of the greater city of Baton Rouge.

## Project Value 💰
Our primary customers are city agencies, local nonprofits, and community development partners working in North Baton Rouge, who need accurate, real-time neighborhood data to inform their actions. ReVytalize provides them with a continuous stream of verified blight reports, thereby reducing the time wasted on duplicate or low-quality complaints. Tangibly, this leads to faster cleanups, more intelligent budget allocation, stronger grant applications, and measurable environmental improvement in the communities they serve.

## Tech Overview 💻
**... What tech was used to bring this project to life?**
The leading technology we used to help perfect the app is called mgx. It's a simple AI app-building tool that helps ensure the app runs smoothly and that the code is error-free, without any unexpected issues that could interrupt the code, such as syntax errors or backend and frontend problems. The app is defined through MGX’s orchestration layer, which uses a system prompt to specify behavior and, optionally, tools that the model can call, such as HTTP requests to external APIs. When a user pastes a URL, such as an ArcGIS or dashboard link, the platform doesn’t automatically embed a live, interactive map. Instead, it either treats the URL as plain text context for the model or, if explicitly configured, as an endpoint that the model can call. To display something precise, like a Baton Rouge blight map instead of random images, the app configuration must explicitly wire in the correct map or data API endpoints and provide instructions on how the model should use and present that data.


Example:
* FastAPI
* Hugging Face AI Models
* Next.js
* Java
* ReactJS
